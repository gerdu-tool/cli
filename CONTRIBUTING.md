that should get you started.

   to your username.
2. Clone your forked repository locally `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/cli.git`.
3. You must [configure a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) for your fork so that you can [sync changes you make](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the original repository.

   will install the dependencies.
